In the existing system process of booking photography session was done manually by phone calls or drop by at their place. It is hard to track the availability of the photographer and to manage all the bookings made by customers.
Lens LineUp is a project which will enable customers or clients to book for professional photographer by viewing their qualification and previous works (some of the photos took by them should be on their profile) via online. It is difficult for those who want to book for photography session to request for their favorite photographer since the process was done manually. By having this system, it will be easier for them to make their booking. 
New photographers can register in this website by creating their own profiles and hence it provides a small job opportunity for the freshers.User module can get register as new user and login for booking and payment.
